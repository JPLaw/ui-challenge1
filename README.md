Create a responsive webpage from a provided design comp
Your boss comes up to you just before lunch: "OK, we just picked up this job, but I need it before 2:00 this afternoon. It doesn't need to be perfect... it needs to be as close to perfect as you can get it in that time."

In lab today you will be building a single responsive webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, but no JS or jQuery.

Your document must be designed in a mobile-first approach and must be responsive when the screen size changes. The details of the media query specifications are up to you, but your breakpoint must be at 960 pixels, because that is what our imaginary client wants.
